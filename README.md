# elyft-compressor
Javascript library for compress and change images extension

## Context
Developers have always had to work with images in their web and mobile applications, if it is possible for them to compress images with online tools, it is not easy for them to compress images dynamically, for example when a user uploads a photo.
Elyft Compressor was created to solve this problem and allow developpers to compress images right on the users devices.
Elyft Compressor is surprisingly fast and agnostic, it can be integrated into any existing javascript project.
